# Wwack-A-Mole and Red-Light, Green-Light
 Games made in Wwise
 
 This repository started with only one game, but now ther's actually 2 of them!
 
 ## Wwack-A-Mole
 Take a break from your hard work of sound designing and Wwise and play a fun little game inside of Wwise's soundcaster. The gameplay is fairly simply and resembles the traditional wwack-a-Mole game that you know and love from tivolis and carnevals where you have to hit a mole with a hammer as quickly as you can before it dissapears again.
 
Instructions to play:
1. Press F6 to activate the profiler view
2. Press both the _start Capture_ and _Show Live Data_ buttons in the top toolbar
3. Make sure that the _Voice Graphs_ tab is visible.
4. In the _Object Filter_ text field, locate the Work Unit in the _Mixer Master Hiearchy_ called **WwackAMole** to only see the moles and releveant info popping up on the screen.
5. Open the Soundcaster and place it underneath the voice graph, so you can see both at the same time. Open the session called _Wwack-A-Mole_
6. Press **Game start** enjoy the music and start wwacking some moles by pressing the events on the Soundcaster screen!
