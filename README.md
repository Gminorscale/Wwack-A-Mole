# Wwack-A-Mole
 A game made in Wwise
 
 
 Take a break from your hard work of sound designing and Wwise and play a fun little game inside of Wwise's soundcaster. The gameplay is fairly simply and resembles the traditional wwack-a-Mole game that you know and love from tivolis and carnevals where you have to hit a mole with a hammer as quickly as you can before it dissapears again.
 
Instructions to play:
1. Press F6 to activate the profiler view
2. Press both the _start Capture_ and _Show Live Data_ buttons in the top toolbar
3. Make sure that the _Voice Graphs_ tab is visible.
4. In the filter text field, write out **mole** to only see the moles popping up on the screen.
5. Open the Soundcaster and place it underneath the voice graph, so you can see both at the same time. Open the session called _Wwack-A-Mole_
6. Press **Game start** enjoy the music and start wwacking some moles by pressing the events on the Soundcaster screen!



_Be free to modify it and have fun with it. I hope you will have a wwwonderful time playing it_
